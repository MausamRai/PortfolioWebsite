            <h2>
                Impact of Internet on daily life
            </h2>
            <p>
                <ul>In our daily life we use internet to do our different tasks such as paying bills, watching different
                    series, communication etc. Nowadays,it is really difficult to avoid internet as we depend on it for
                    many porposes. Many of us use it for viewing our favourite musics, video as well as movies,playing
                    our favourite games and to communicate with our relatives and friends.Internet has helped many
                    people to do ddifferent things and get connected with rest of the world.<br> Though there are alots
                    of merits to internet many people uses it to bully other, blackmail by posting the video which may
                    cause any damage to her image in society. Over 90% of website are filled with pornography which
                    cause addiction to the people and youth which may become their habit for rest of the life.<br> Their
                    are alot of pons and cons of the internet on our daily life which also depends upon the user. Many
                    are hung upon the internet that they forget real world and start assumuming to live there. Internet
                    make youth lazy as they have to sit in one place and their body lack the possible movements which
                    may causes different problem to their body. Many people around the world uses the internet to get
                    what they need and to explore new things and get to know tha world which is very helpful but on the
                    other hand it causes different damages physically and emotionally if misused. Internet can be used
                    in different fields of work and is efficient as well.<br>Most of may not be consious but its has
                    becomes our habits and its hard to not depend on it. As you see in my household of 9 members there
                    is not a single one which doesnot use mobile and internet. They consume data everyday as it is the
                    only way to spend wuility time while surfing around the world. Internet is is a golbally used
                    technology which brings us together through socail media. In this century people who aren't in
                    socail media or internet are dumb or so they say. Most likely there are 90% of your solution on
                    internet and to avoid using it is our own loss but it should be used accordingly. Internet has
                    become the daily part of our life. From when we wake up to the night we consume the internet in one
                    way or another. If we want to paly our fav game there is uses of internet and if we want to surf
                    arounf the socail media there is internet as well. Even if we want to pay our bills and all the
                    transaction are online which is easier but it also shows pir dependency of internet on our daily
                    life.</ul>
